<h3> PROJECT DESCRIPTION </h3> 

BrighterLife is an online counselling platform where users can sign up and explore three categories of help that are provided by us, which are Stress, Anxiety, and Depression. Users can select which category they are currently struggling with and we will appoint a session with our professional certified therapists. Based on the availability of timings and date, the user can select a slot and book it for him/herself. We change the way people get help with facing life's challenges by providing convenient, discreet and affordable access to a licensed therapist. 
BrighterLife makes professional counseling available anytime, anywhere, through a computer, tablet or smartphone.
